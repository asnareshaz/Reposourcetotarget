This project is a POC for testing the functionalities of Azure Data Factory in order to adapt with the requirements from the problem statement.

**What is Azure Data Factory?**

Azure Data Factory is a cloud-based data integration service for creating ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) and ETL pipelines. It allows users to create data processing workflows in the cloud, either through a graphical interface or by writing code, for orchestrating and automating data movement and data transformation. It is possible to build complex ETL processes that transform data visually with data flows or by using compute services such as Azure HDInsight Hadoop, Azure Databricks, and Azure SQL Database.

**Requirement**

Create, run and manage pipelines for data transfer between Azure blob storage & Azure Blob Storage.
